										Health.</span></div><div><span id="digesttext"><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(1) Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law creates the continuously appropriated Medical Providers Interim Payment Fund for the purposes of paying Medi‑Cal providers, providers of drug treatment services for persons infected with HIV, and providers of services for the developmentally disabled, during a fiscal year for which a budget has not yet been enacted or there is a deficiency in the Medi‑Cal budget. During a fiscal year in which these payments are necessary, existing law requires the Controller to transfer up to
		$1,000,000,000 from the General Fund in the form of loans to the continuously appropriated Medical Providers Interim Payment Fund, and appropriates $1,000,000,000 from the Federal Trust Fund to that fund. Existing law requires those loans to be repaid by debiting the appropriate Budget Act item following a procedure prescribed by the Department of Finance. Upon the enactment of the annual Budget Act or a deficiency bill, existing law requires the Controller to transfer expenditures and unexpended funds in the Medical Providers Interim Payment Fund to the appropriate Budget Act item.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would require the Controller to make those loan transfers upon order of the Department of Finance. The bill would increase the maximum amount of loan transfers annually from the General Fund to the continuously appropriated Medical Providers Interim Payment Fund to $2,000,000,000, would require the Department of Finance to notify the Legislature within 10 days of authorizing a
		transfer, and would increase the appropriation from the Federal Trust Fund to the Medical Providers Interim Payment Fund to $2,000,000,000 during a fiscal year for which a budget has not yet been enacted or when there is a deficiency in the Medi‑Cal budget. By increasing the amounts paid into a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would require a loan to be repaid either in the same fiscal year in which it was made or in the subsequent fiscal year, as specified, by debiting the appropriate Budget Act item or using the proceeds of a supplemental appropriations bill, as determined by the State Department of Health Care Services, in consultation with the Department of Finance, and inform the Controller within 30 days of enactment of the Budget Act or a supplemental appropriations bill.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(2) Existing federal law, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), enacts various health care
		coverage market reforms that took effect January 1, 2014. Among other things, PPACA requires each state, by January 1, 2014, to establish an American Health Benefit Exchange that facilitates the purchase of qualified health plans by qualified individuals and qualified small employers. Existing state law establishes the California Health Benefit Exchange, also known as Covered California, within state government for the purpose of facilitating the enrollment of qualified individuals and qualified small employers in qualified health plans. </div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would require the Exchange, in consultation with stakeholders and the Legislature, to develop options for providing financial assistance to help low- and middle-income Californians access health care coverage, as specified, and would require the Exchange to report those developed options to the Legislature, Governor, and Council on Health Care Delivery Systems on or before
		February 1, 2019.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would also establish the Council on Health Care Delivery Systems as an independent body to develop a plan that includes options for advancing progress toward achieving a health care delivery system in California that provides coverage and access through a unified financing system for all Californians. The bill would, on or before October 1, 2021, require the council to submit to the Legislature and Governor a plan with options that include a timeline of the benchmarks and steps necessary to implement health care delivery system changes, and would require the plan to be posted on the California Health and Human Services Agency’s Internet Web site. The bill would require the plan to consider, at a minimum, among other things, key design options, including covered benefits, eligibility, service delivery, provider payments, and quality improvement, and opportunities for controlling health care costs. The bill would
		require the council to provide an update detailing its progress in developing the plan to the Governor and the health committees of the Senate and Assembly on or before January 1, 2020, and every 6 months thereafter. The bill would authorize the California Health and Human Services Agency to provide staff support to implement these provisions, and would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2022.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(3) Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health and sets forth its powers and duties, including, but not limited to, the licensing and regulation of various health facilities. Existing law sets forth the per-bed or per-facility licensing and certification fee for the various regulated facilities. Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health Licensing and Certification Program Fund and requires deposit of the fees into the fund to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the support of
		the department’s licensing and certification program.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would, commencing in the 2018–19 fiscal year, authorize the department to assess a supplemental license fee on facilities located in the County of Los Angeles for all of these facility types. The bill would require the department to calculate the supplemental license fee based upon the difference between the estimated costs of regulating facility types licensed in the County of Los Angeles, including, but not limited to, the costs associated with the department’s contract for licensing and certification activities with the County of Los Angeles.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(4) Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health to license and regulate primary care clinics and specialty clinics. Existing law requires these clinics to comply with specific statutory provisions for standards of care and regulations promulgated by the
		department, and a violation of these provisions or regulations is a crime.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would require a chronic dialysis clinic, surgical clinic, or rehabilitation clinic licensed or seeking a license to comply with prescribed federal certification standards in effect immediately preceding January 1, 2018. By expanding the standards by which licensed clinics are required to comply, this bill would expand the scope of a crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(5) Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health and the State Department of Developmental Services to jointly develop and implement licensing regulations appropriate for an intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled-nursing and an intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled-continuous nursing. Existing law requires these facilities to comply with specific statutory provisions for standards of care and
		regulations promulgated by these departments, and a violation of these provisions or regulations is a crime.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would require an intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled-nursing to comply with prescribed federal certification standards in effect immediately preceding January 1, 2018. By expanding the standards by which this type of facility is required to comply, this bill would expand the scope of a crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(6) Existing law authorizes the Director of Public Health to establish and administer a program within the department’s Office of AIDS to subsidize certain costs of medications for the prevention of HIV infection and other related medical services to residents of California who are at least 18 years of age, who are HIV negative, and who meet specified other requirements. Existing law authorizes the program to subsidize the costs of
		HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-related medical services for uninsured individuals who are enrolled in a drug manufacturer’s PrEP medication assistance program. These provisions apply only to the extent that funding is available, as specified.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would revise the criteria for participation in the program by making it available to minors who are 12 years of age or older and who may consent to medical care, under specified circumstances. The bill would authorize the program to subsidize the cost of medication for the prevention of HIV infection for uninsured individuals who are ineligible for a drug manufacturer’s medication assistance program. The bill would authorize the program to subsidize the cost of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)-related medical services for both insured and uninsured individuals, as specified. The bill would also authorize the program to subsidize, without regard to eligibility and for the prevention of HIV infection, up to 14 days

Existing law authorizes a Medi-Cal provider to identify and recommend participation in the DPP to a beneficiary who meets specified requirements.

		authorizes a publicly owned or operated clinic that is enrolled as a Medi-Cal provider and that provides services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries to receive supplemental Medi-Cal reimbursement, as specified, in addition to the rate of payment that the facility would otherwise receive for Medi-Cal outpatient services. Existing law requires an eligible facility, as a condition of receiving supplemental reimbursement, to enter into, and maintain, an agreement with the State Department of Health Care Services for the purposes of implementing those provisions and reimbursing the department for the costs of administering them.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would repeal the above-described provisions relating to the supplemental Medi-Cal reimbursement.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Under existing law, the department contracts with Medi-Cal providers, such as federally qualified health centers, fee-for-service providers, and managed care plans to provide medically

		audit-related payment recoveries to allow for modification in the amounts withheld from an applicable provider payment or the timing of repayments upon request of an individual provider and demonstration of hardship. The bill would require the provider to request that relief in the form and manner specified by the department before the department takes action to recoup or recover the funds.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(18) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(19) The California Constitution requires the state

					 or post-traumatic stress disorder, but excluding antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia. Evidence of the defendant’s mental disorder shall be provided by the defense and shall include a recent diagnosis by a qualified mental health expert. In opining that a defendant suffers from a qualifying disorder, the qualified mental health expert may rely on an examination of the defendant, the defendant’s medical records, arrest reports, or any other relevant evidence.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(2) The court is satisfied that the defendant’s mental disorder played a significant role in the commission of the charged offense. A court may conclude that a defendant’s mental disorder played a significant role in the commission of the charged offense if, after reviewing any relevant and credible evidence, including, but not limited to, police reports, preliminary hearing transcripts, witness statements, statements by the defendant’s mental
					 health treatment provider, medical records, records or reports by qualified medical experts, or evidence that the defendant displayed symptoms consistent with the relevant mental disorder at or near the time of the offense, the court concludes that the defendant’s mental disorder substantially contributed to the defendant’s involvement in the commission of the offense.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(3) In the opinion of a qualified mental health expert, the defendant’s symptoms motivating the criminal behavior would respond to mental health treatment.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(4) The defendant consents to diversion and waives his or her right to a speedy trial, unless a defendant has been found to be an appropriate candidate for diversion in lieu of commitment pursuant to clause (iv) of subparagraph (B) paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 1370 and, as a result of his or her mental incompetence, cannot consent to diversion or
					 give a knowing and intelligent waiver of his or her right to a speedy trial.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(5) The defendant agrees to comply with treatment as a condition of diversion.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(6) The court is satisfied that the defendant will not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, as defined in Section 1170.18, if treated in the community. The court may consider the opinions of the district attorney, the defense, or a qualified mental health expert, and may consider the defendant’s violence and criminal history, the current charged offense, and any other factors that the court deems appropriate.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(c) As used in this chapter, “pretrial diversion” means the postponement of prosecution, either temporarily or permanently, at any point in the judicial process from the point at which the accused is charged until adjudication, to allow the
					 defendant to undergo mental health treatment, subject to all of the following:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(1) (A) The court is satisfied that the recommended inpatient or outpatient program of mental health treatment will meet the specialized mental health treatment needs of the defendant.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(B) The defendant may be referred to a program of mental health treatment utilizing existing inpatient or outpatient mental health resources. Before approving a proposed treatment program, the court shall consider the request of the defense, the request of the prosecution, the needs of the defendant, and the interests of the community. The treatment may be procured using private or public funds, and a referral may be made to a county mental health agency, existing collaborative courts, or assisted outpatient treatment only if that entity has agreed to accept responsibility for the treatment of the
					 defendant, and mental health services are provided only to the extent that resources are available and the defendant is eligible for those services.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(2) The provider of the mental health treatment program in which the defendant has been placed shall provide regular reports to the court, the defense, and the prosecutor on the defendant’s progress in treatment.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(3) The period during which criminal proceedings against the defendant may be diverted shall be no longer than two years.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(d) If any of the following circumstances exists, the court shall, after notice to the defendant, defense counsel, and the prosecution, hold a hearing to determine whether the criminal proceedings should be reinstated, whether the treatment should be modified, or whether the defendant should be conserved and referred to the conservatorship
					 investigator of the county of commitment to initiate conservatorship proceedings for the defendant pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 5350) of Part 1 of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(1) The defendant is charged with an additional misdemeanor allegedly committed during the pretrial diversion and that reflects the defendant’s propensity for violence.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(2) The defendant is charged with an additional felony allegedly committed during the pretrial diversion.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(3) The defendant is engaged in criminal conduct rendering him or her unsuitable for diversion.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(4) Based on the opinion of a qualified mental health expert whom the court may deem appropriate, either of the following circumstances exists:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(A) The defendant is performing unsatisfactorily in the assigned program.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(B) The defendant is gravely disabled, as defined in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of Section 5008 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. A defendant shall only be conserved and referred to the conservatorship investigator pursuant to this finding.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(e) If the defendant has performed satisfactorily in diversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant’s criminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings at the time of the initial diversion. A court may conclude that the defendant has performed satisfactorily if the defendant has substantially complied with the requirements of diversion, has avoided significant new violations of law unrelated to the defendant’s mental health
					 condition, and has a plan in place for long-term mental health care. If the court dismisses the charges, the clerk of the court shall file a record with the Department of Justice indicating the disposition of the case diverted pursuant to this section. Upon successful completion of diversion, if the court dismisses the charges, the arrest upon which the diversion was based shall be deemed never to have occurred, and the court shall order access to the record of the arrest restricted in accordance with Section 1001.9, except as specified in subdivisions (g) and (h). The defendant who successfully completes diversion may indicate in response to any question concerning his or her prior criminal record that he or she was not arrested or diverted for the offense, except as specified in subdivision (g).</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(f) A record pertaining to an arrest resulting in successful completion of diversion, or any record generated as a result of the defendant’s
					 application for or participation in diversion, shall not, without the defendant’s consent, be used in any way that could result in the denial of any employment, benefit, license, or certificate.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(g) The defendant shall be advised that, regardless of his or her completion of diversion, both of the following apply:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(1) The arrest upon which the diversion was based may be disclosed by the Department of Justice to any peace officer application request and that, notwithstanding subdivision (f), this section does not relieve the defendant of the obligation to disclose the arrest in response to any direct question contained in any questionnaire or application for a position as a peace officer, as defined in Section 830.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(2) An order to seal records pertaining to an arrest made pursuant to this section has no effect on a

If either determination is made, the prosecutor shall so notify the court and defendant in writing. After this notification, and opportunity for hearing, the court shall order that the defendant be delivered by the sheriff to a State Department of State Hospitals facility, as directed by the State Department of State Hospitals, or other secure treatment facility for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered unless the court makes specific findings on the record that an alternative placement would provide more appropriate treatment for the defendant and would not pose a danger to the health and safety of others.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(iii) If the action against the

If, in the opinion of that expert, the defendant has regained competence, the court shall proceed as if a certificate of restoration of competence has been returned pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 1372, except that a presumption of competency shall not apply and a hearing shall be held to determine whether competency has been restored.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(2) Prior to making the order directing that the defendant be committed to the State Department of State Hospitals or other treatment facility or placed on outpatient status, the court shall proceed as follows:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(A) The court shall order the community program director or a designee

The court shall consider opinions in the reports prepared pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1369, as applicable to the issue of whether the defendant lacks capacity to make decisions regarding the administration of antipsychotic medication, and shall proceed as follows:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(i) The court shall hear and determine whether any of the following is true:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(I) The defendant lacks capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication, the defendant’s mental disorder requires medical treatment with antipsychotic medication, and, if the defendant’s mental disorder is not treated with antipsychotic medication, it is probable that serious harm to the physical or mental health of the patient will result. Probability of serious harm to the physical or mental health of the defendant requires evidence that the defendant is presently suffering adverse effects to his or her
				  physical or mental health, or the defendant has previously suffered these effects as a result of a mental disorder and his or her condition is substantially deteriorating. The fact that a defendant has a diagnosis of a mental disorder does not alone establish probability of serious harm to the physical or mental health of the defendant.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(II) The defendant is a danger to others, in that the defendant has inflicted, attempted to inflict, or made a serious threat of inflicting substantial physical harm on another while in custody, or the defendant had inflicted, attempted to inflict, or made a serious threat of inflicting substantial physical harm on another that resulted in his or her being taken into custody, and the defendant presents, as a result of mental disorder or mental defect, a demonstrated danger of inflicting substantial physical harm on others. Demonstrated danger may be based on an assessment of the defendant’s present mental
				  condition, including a consideration of past behavior of the defendant within six years prior to the time the defendant last attempted to inflict, inflicted, or threatened to inflict substantial physical harm on another, and other relevant evidence.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(III) The people have charged the defendant with a serious crime against the person or property, involuntary administration of antipsychotic medication is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial, the medication is unlikely to have side effects that interfere with the defendant’s ability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a reasonable manner, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to have substantially the same results, and antipsychotic medication is in the patient’s best medical interest in light of his or her medical condition.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(ii) If
				  the court finds any of the conditions described in clause (i) to be true, the court shall issue an order authorizing involuntary administration of antipsychotic medication to the defendant when and as prescribed by the defendant’s treating psychiatrist at any facility housing the defendant for purposes of this chapter. The order shall be valid for no more than one year, pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (7). The court shall not order involuntary administration of psychotropic medication under subclause (III) of clause (i) unless the court has first found that the defendant does not meet the criteria for involuntary administration of psychotropic medication under subclause (I) of clause (i) and does not meet the criteria under subclause (II) of clause (i).</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(iii) In all cases, the treating hospital, facility, or program may administer medically appropriate antipsychotic medication prescribed by a psychiatrist in an emergency as described
				  in subdivision (m) of Section 5008 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(iv) If the court has determined that the defendant has the capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication, and if the defendant, with advice of his or her counsel, consents, the court order of commitment shall include confirmation that antipsychotic medication may be given to the defendant as prescribed by a treating psychiatrist pursuant to the defendant’s consent. The commitment order shall also indicate that, if the defendant withdraws consent for antipsychotic medication, after the treating psychiatrist complies with the provisions of subparagraph (C), the defendant shall be returned to court for a hearing in accordance with subparagraphs (C) and (D) regarding whether antipsychotic medication shall be administered involuntarily.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(v) If the court has determined that the defendant has the
				  capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication and if the defendant, with advice from his or her counsel, does not consent, the court order for commitment shall indicate that, after the treating psychiatrist complies with the provisions of subparagraph (C), the defendant shall be returned to court for a hearing in accordance with subparagraphs (C) and (D) regarding whether antipsychotic medication shall be administered involuntarily.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(vi) A report made pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) shall include a description of antipsychotic medication administered to the defendant and its effects and side effects, including effects on the defendant’s appearance or behavior that would affect the defendant’s ability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a reasonable manner. During the time the defendant is confined in a State Department of State Hospitals facility
				  or other treatment facility or placed on outpatient status, either the defendant or the people may request that the court review any order made pursuant to this subdivision. The defendant, to the same extent enjoyed by other patients in the State Department of State Hospitals facility or other treatment facility, shall have the right to contact the patients’ rights advocate regarding his or her rights under this section.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(C) If the defendant consented to antipsychotic medication as described in clause (iv) of subparagraph (B), but subsequently withdraws his or her consent, or, if involuntary antipsychotic medication was not ordered pursuant to clause (v) of subparagraph (B), and the treating psychiatrist determines that antipsychotic medication has become medically necessary and appropriate, the treating psychiatrist shall make efforts to obtain informed consent from the defendant for antipsychotic medication. If informed consent is not
				  obtained from the defendant, and the treating psychiatrist is of the opinion that the defendant lacks capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication based on the conditions described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i) of subparagraph (B), the treating psychiatrist shall certify whether the lack of capacity and any applicable conditions described above exist. That certification shall contain an assessment of the current mental status of the defendant and the opinion of the treating psychiatrist that involuntary antipsychotic medication has become medically necessary and appropriate.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(D) (i) If the treating psychiatrist certifies that antipsychotic medication has become medically necessary and appropriate pursuant to subparagraph (C), antipsychotic medication may be administered to the defendant for not more than 21 days, provided, however, that, within 72 hours of the certification, the defendant is
				  provided a medication review hearing before an administrative law judge to be conducted at the facility where the defendant is receiving treatment. The treating psychiatrist shall present the case for the certification for involuntary treatment and the defendant shall be represented by an attorney or a patients’ rights advocate. The attorney or patients’ rights advocate shall be appointed to meet with the defendant no later than one day prior to the medication review hearing to review the defendant’s rights at the medication review hearing, discuss the process, answer questions or concerns regarding involuntary medication or the hearing, assist the defendant in preparing for the hearing and advocating for his or her interests at the hearing, review the panel’s final determination following the hearing, advise the defendant of his or her right to judicial review of the panel’s decision, and provide the defendant with referral information for legal advice on the subject. The defendant shall also have the
				  following rights with respect to the medication review hearing:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(I) To be given timely access to the defendant’s records.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(II) To be present at the hearing, unless the defendant waives that right.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(III) To present evidence at the hearing.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(IV) To question persons presenting evidence supporting involuntary medication.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(V) To make reasonable requests for attendance of witnesses on the defendant’s behalf.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(VI) To a hearing conducted in an impartial and informal manner.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(ii) If the administrative law judge determines that the defendant either meets the criteria
				  specified in subclause (I) of clause (i) of subparagraph (B), or meets the criteria specified in subclause (II) of clause (i) of subparagraph (B), antipsychotic medication may continue to be administered to the defendant for the 21-day certification period. Concurrently with the treating psychiatrist’s certification, the treating psychiatrist shall file a copy of the certification and a petition with the court for issuance of an order to administer antipsychotic medication beyond the 21-day certification period. For purposes of this subparagraph, the treating psychiatrist shall not be required to pay or deposit any fee for the filing of the petition or other document or paper related to the petition.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(iii) If the administrative law judge disagrees with the certification, medication may not be administered involuntarily until the court determines that
				  antipsychotic medication should be administered pursuant to this section.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(iv) The court shall provide notice to the prosecuting attorney and to the attorney representing the defendant, and shall hold a hearing, no later than 18 days from the date of the certification, to determine whether antipsychotic medication should be ordered beyond the certification period.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(v) If, as a result of the hearing, the court determines that antipsychotic medication should be administered beyond the certification period, the court shall issue an order authorizing the administration of that medication.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(vi) The court shall render its decision on the petition and issue its order no later than three calendar days after the hearing and, in any event, no later than the expiration of the 21-day certification period.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(vii) If the administrative law judge upholds the certification pursuant to clause (ii), the court may, for a period not to exceed 14 days, extend the certification and continue the hearing pursuant to stipulation between the parties or upon a finding of good cause. In determining good cause, the court may review the petition filed with the court, the administrative law judge’s order, and any additional testimony needed by the court to determine if it is appropriate to continue medication beyond the 21-day certification and for a period of up to 14 days.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(viii) The district attorney, county counsel, or representative of a facility where a defendant found incompetent to stand trial is committed may petition the court for an order to administer involuntary medication pursuant to the criteria set forth in subclauses (II) and (III) of clause (i) of subparagraph (B). The order is
				  reviewable as provided in paragraph (7).</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(3) When the court orders that the defendant be committed to a State Department of State Hospitals facility or other public or private treatment facility, the court shall provide copies of the following documents prior to the admission of the defendant to the State Department of State Hospitals or other treatment facility where the defendant is to be committed:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(A) The commitment order, including a specification of the charges.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(B) A computation or statement setting forth the maximum term of commitment in accordance with subdivision (c).</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(C) A computation or statement setting forth the amount of credit for time served, if any, to be deducted from the maximum term of commitment.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(D) State summary criminal history information.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(E) Arrest reports prepared by the police department or other law enforcement agency.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(F) Court-ordered psychiatric examination or evaluation reports.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(G) The community program director’s placement recommendation report.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(H) Records of a finding of mental incompetence pursuant to this chapter arising out of a complaint charging a felony offense specified in Section 290 or a pending Section 1368 proceeding arising out of a charge of a Section 290 offense.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(I) Medical records.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(4) When the defendant is committed to a
				  treatment facility pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) or the court makes the findings specified in clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) to assign the defendant to a treatment facility other than a State Department of State Hospitals facility or other secure treatment facility, the court shall order that notice be given to the appropriate law enforcement agency or agencies having local jurisdiction at the site of the placement facility of any finding of mental incompetence pursuant to this chapter arising out of a charge of a Section 290 offense.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(5) When directing that the defendant be confined in a State Department of State Hospitals facility pursuant to this subdivision, the court shall commit the patient to the State Department of State Hospitals.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(6) (A) If the defendant is committed or transferred to the
				  State Department of State Hospitals pursuant to this section, the court may, upon receiving the written recommendation of the medical director of the State Department of State Hospitals facility and the community program director that the defendant be transferred to a public or private treatment facility approved by the community program director, order the defendant transferred to that facility. If the defendant is committed or transferred to a public or private treatment facility approved by the community program director, the court may, upon receiving the written recommendation of the community program director, transfer the defendant to the State Department of State Hospitals or to another public or private treatment facility approved by the community program director. In the event of dismissal of the criminal charges before the defendant recovers competence, the person shall be subject to the applicable provisions of the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Part 1 (commencing with Section 5000) of Division 5 of
				  the Welfare and Institutions Code). If either the defendant or the prosecutor chooses to contest either kind of order of transfer, a petition may be filed in the court for a hearing, which shall be held if the court determines that sufficient grounds exist. At the hearing, the prosecuting attorney or the defendant may present evidence bearing on the order of transfer. The court shall use the same standards as are used in conducting probation revocation hearings pursuant to Section 1203.2.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Prior to making an order for transfer under this section, the court shall notify the defendant, the attorney of record for the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, and the community program director or a designee.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(B) If the defendant is initially committed to a State Department of State Hospitals facility or secure treatment facility pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) and is
				  subsequently transferred to any other facility, copies of the documents specified in paragraph (3) shall be taken with the defendant to each subsequent facility to which the defendant is transferred. The transferring facility shall also notify the appropriate law enforcement agency or agencies having local jurisdiction at the site of the new facility that the defendant is a person subject to clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1).</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(7) (A) An order by the court authorizing involuntary medication of the defendant shall be valid for no more than one year. The court shall review the order at the time of the review of the initial report and the six-month progress reports pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) to determine if the grounds for the authorization remain. In the review, the court shall consider the reports of the treating psychiatrist or psychiatrists and the defendant’s patients’ rights
				  advocate or attorney. The court may require testimony from the treating psychiatrist and the patients’ rights advocate or attorney, if necessary. The court may continue the order authorizing involuntary medication for up to another six months, or vacate the order, or make any other appropriate order.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(B) Within 60 days before the expiration of the one-year involuntary medication order, the district attorney, county counsel, or representative of any facility where a defendant found incompetent to stand trial is committed may petition the committing court for a renewal, subject to the same conditions and requirements as in subparagraph (A). The petition shall include the basis for involuntary medication set forth in clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2). Notice of the petition shall be provided to the defendant, the defendant’s attorney, and the district attorney. The court shall hear and determine whether the defendant continues to
				  meet the criteria set forth in clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2). The hearing on any petition to renew an order for involuntary medication shall be conducted prior to the expiration of the current order.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(8) For purposes of subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2) and paragraph (7), if the treating psychiatrist determines that there is a need, based on preserving his or her rapport with the patient or preventing harm, the treating psychiatrist may request that the facility medical director designate another psychiatrist to act in the place of the treating psychiatrist. If the medical director of the facility designates another psychiatrist to act pursuant to this paragraph, the treating psychiatrist shall brief the acting psychiatrist of the relevant facts of the case and the acting psychiatrist shall examine the patient prior to the hearing.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(b) (1) Within 90 days of a commitment made pursuant to subdivision (a), the medical director of the State Department of State Hospitals facility or other treatment facility to which the defendant is confined shall make a written report to the court and the community program director for the county or region of commitment, or a designee, concerning the defendant’s progress toward recovery of mental competence and whether the administration of antipsychotic medication remains necessary. If the defendant is on outpatient status, the outpatient treatment staff shall make a written report to the community program director concerning the defendant’s progress toward recovery of mental competence. Within 90 days of placement on outpatient status, the community program director shall report to the court on this matter. If the defendant has not recovered mental competence, but the report discloses a substantial likelihood that the defendant will regain mental competence in the foreseeable future, the
				  defendant shall remain in the State Department of State Hospitals facility or other treatment facility or on outpatient status. Thereafter, at six-month intervals or until the defendant becomes mentally competent, if the defendant is confined in a treatment facility, the medical director of the State Department of State Hospitals facility or person in charge of the facility shall report in writing to the court and the community program director or a designee regarding the defendant’s progress toward recovery of mental competence and whether the administration of antipsychotic medication remains necessary. If the defendant is on outpatient status, after the initial 90-day report, the outpatient treatment staff shall report to the community program director on the defendant’s progress toward recovery, and the community program director shall report to the court on this matter at six-month intervals. A copy of these reports shall be provided to the prosecutor and defense counsel by the court.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(A) If the report indicates that there is no substantial likelihood that the defendant will regain mental competence in the foreseeable future, the committing court shall order the defendant to be returned to the court for proceedings pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) no later than 10 days following receipt of the report. The court shall transmit a copy of its order to the community program director or a designee.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(B) If the report indicates that there is no substantial likelihood that the defendant will regain mental competence in the foreseeable future, the medical director of the State Department of State Hospitals facility or other treatment facility to which the defendant is confined shall do both of the following:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(i) Promptly notify and provide a copy of the report to the defense counsel and the

No person shall be admitted to a treatment facility or placed on outpatient status under this section without having been evaluated by the county mental health director or his or her designee. No person shall be admitted to a state hospital under this section unless the county mental health director finds

Probability of serious harm to the physical or mental health of the defendant requires evidence that the defendant is presently suffering adverse effects to his or her physical or mental health, or the defendant has previously suffered these effects as a result of a mental
				  disorder and his or her condition is substantially deteriorating. The fact that a defendant has a diagnosis of a mental disorder does not alone establish probability of serious harm to the physical or mental health of the defendant.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(II) The defendant is a danger to others, in that the defendant has inflicted, attempted to inflict, or made a serious threat of inflicting substantial physical harm on another while in custody, or the defendant had inflicted, attempted to inflict, or made a serious threat of inflicting substantial physical harm on another that resulted in his or her being taken into custody, and the defendant presents, as a result of mental disorder or mental defect, a demonstrated danger of inflicting substantial physical harm on others. Demonstrated danger may be based on an assessment of the defendant’s present mental condition, including a consideration of past behavior of the defendant within six years prior to the time the
				  defendant last attempted to inflict, inflicted, or threatened to inflict substantial physical harm on another, and other relevant evidence.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(III) The people have charged the defendant with a serious crime against the person or property; involuntary administration of antipsychotic medication is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial; the medication is unlikely to have side effects that interfere with the defendant’s ability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a reasonable manner; less intrusive treatments are unlikely to have substantially the same results; and antipsychotic medication is in the patient’s best medical interest in light of his or her medical condition.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(iii) If the court finds any of the conditions described in clause (ii) to be true, the court shall issue an order

During the time the defendant is confined in a state hospital or other treatment facility or placed on outpatient status, either the defendant or the people may request that the court review any order made pursuant to this subdivision. The defendant, to the same extent enjoyed by other patients in the state hospital or other treatment facility, shall have the right to contact the patients’ rights advocate regarding his or her rights under this section.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(C) If the defendant consented to antipsychotic medication as described in clause (i) of subparagraph (B), but subsequently withdraws his or her consent, or, if involuntary antipsychotic medication was not
				  ordered pursuant to clause (ii) of subparagraph (B), and the treating psychiatrist determines that antipsychotic medication has become medically necessary and appropriate, the treating psychiatrist shall make efforts to obtain informed consent from the defendant for antipsychotic medication. If informed consent is not obtained from the defendant, and the treating psychiatrist is of the opinion that the defendant lacks capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication as specified in subclause (I) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (B), or that the defendant is a danger to others as specified in subclause (II) of clause (ii) of subparagraph (B), the committing court shall be notified of this, including an assessment of the current mental status of the defendant and the opinion of the treating psychiatrist that involuntary antipsychotic medication has become medically necessary and appropriate.

In the event of dismissal of the criminal charges before the defendant recovers competence, the person shall be subject to the applicable provisions of Part 1 (commencing with Section 5000) of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. Where either the defendant or the prosecutor chooses to contest the order of transfer, a petition may be filed in the court for a hearing, which shall be held if the court determines that sufficient grounds exist. At the hearing, the prosecuting attorney or the

The court shall use the same standards as are used in conducting probation revocation hearings pursuant to Section 1203.2.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">Prior to making an order for transfer under this section, the court shall notify the defendant, the attorney of record for the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, and the county mental health director or his or her designee.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(b) Within 90 days of a commitment made pursuant to subdivision (a), the medical director of the treatment facility to which the defendant is confined shall make a written report to the court and the county mental health director or his or her designee, concerning the defendant’s progress toward recovery of mental competence. Where the defendant is on outpatient status, the outpatient treatment staff shall make a written report to the county mental health director concerning the defendant’s
				  progress toward recovery of mental competence. Within 90 days of placement on outpatient status, the county mental health director shall report to the court on this matter. If the defendant has not recovered mental competence, but the report discloses a substantial likelihood that the defendant will regain mental competence in the foreseeable future, the defendant shall remain in the treatment facility or on outpatient status. Thereafter, at six-month intervals or until the defendant becomes mentally competent, where the defendant is confined in a treatment facility, the medical director of the hospital or person in charge of the facility shall report in writing to the court and the county mental health director or a designee regarding the defendant’s progress toward recovery of mental competence. Where the defendant is on outpatient status, after the initial 90-day report, the outpatient treatment staff shall report to the county mental health director on the defendant’s progress toward recovery, and the
				  county mental health director shall report to the court on this matter at six-month intervals. A copy of these reports shall be provided to the prosecutor and defense counsel by the court. If the report indicates that there is no substantial likelihood that the defendant will regain mental competence in the foreseeable future, the committing court shall order the defendant to be returned to the court for proceedings pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c).

Any hearings required in the conservatorship proceedings shall be held in the superior court in the county that ordered the commitment.

In implementing this chapter, the department shall consider local discretion and flexibility in diversion activities that meet the community’s needs and provide for the safe and
					 effective treatment of individuals with serious mental disorders across a continuum of care.</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(c) (1) Subject to appropriation by the Legislature, the department may solicit proposals from, and may contract with, a county to help fund the development or expansion of pretrial diversion described in Chapter 2.8A (commencing with Section 1001.35) of Title 6 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, for the population described in subdivision (b) and that meets all of the following criteria:</div><div style="margin:0 0 1em 0;">(A) Participants are individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, who have the potential to be found incompetent to stand trial for felony charges, pursuant to Section 1368 of the Penal Code, or who have been found incompetent to stand trial pursuant to clause (iv) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 1370 of the

This subdivision shall not preclude the department from specifying reporting formats or from modifying, reducing, or adding data elements or outcome measures from a contracting county, as needed to provide for reporting of effective data and outcome measures. Notwithstanding any other law, but only to the extent not prohibited by federal law, the
